Words:   However,  the  way  I  see  it  is  that  by  blaming  the  pundits  i.e.  "hate  speech",  rather  than  Jared  Lee  Loughner,  we  are  taking  away  the  focus  on  what  it  should  be  and  that  is  that  Mr.  Loughner  committed  murder  and  quite  frankly  I  believe  he  was  mentally  disturbed.
