Abstract Roleset Grouping,Abstract Roleset,Roleset description,numbered args,role descriptions,,Notes to appear in editor,Notes for this sheet
"The following are subgroups that come from the abstract concept menu in the current UMR tool. This page contains the abstract rolesets, which are subdivided into reifications of roles, discourse relation reifications, non-verbal predicate rolesets, and implicit rolesets.

For abstract rolesets: Column A is group names, column B is the roleset name, column C is the roleset's description, column D is the roleset's argument numbers, column 3 is the number argument's description.

**note: Column B should be the definitive list of rolesets-- I've removed a few that were in the current list in the editor, and added a few.",,,,,,,
