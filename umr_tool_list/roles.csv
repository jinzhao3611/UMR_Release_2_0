Group,role,inverse,Notes to appear in tool,Notes for this sheet
"The following are subgroups that come from the Roles menu in the current UMR tool. I've broken them down into clusters that naturally go together: participant roles, non-participant roles, numbered args/ops, and discourse relation roles.

For Roles: Column A is group names, column B is the primary role name, column C is the role's inverse role, and Column D is any notes that should appear in a pop up or something when an annotator hovers over a role. 

**note: Columns B and C should be the definitive list of roles-- I've added/removed any extraneous.",,,,
